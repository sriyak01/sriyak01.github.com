						<h2>The Lost City</h2>
						<p>Petra by Day & Night</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The Lost City. Petra truly is the lost city. From the entrance gate to the actual hidden world wonder, the walk was pretty hefty. My family and I landed in Queen Ali Airport in Amman, Jordan.</p>
					<p>Throughout our stay from the airport to Petra to Dead Sea we hired a driver for the entirety of the Jordan trip. This proved extremely efficient and saved a lot of stress and time we could’ve had to deal with if we did not have a secure driver to take us to each destination. Along with that, he gave us a lot of advice on food places, best times to go to Petra, and realistic time frames. Often, my dad thought one thing but our driver was generally right all along. </p>
					<p>From there it was about a 3 hour drive to Petra, which wasn’t too bad. We stopped at some interesting abandoned castles and took pictures. It was really cool to see completely deserted areas surrounding this castle. Little to absolutely no vegetation. As we entered the main city of Petra, it was extremely hilly and mountainous region. </p>
					<p>The night we arrived we freshened up and went to the Petra by the Night. This was supposedly one of the main attraction that was a “must see”. The drive down to the entrance from the Marriot Petra was very scary. The hills and small roads with houses on both sides and people walking in the middle of the road and no side rails when going downhill, was very intimidating. However, we made it out perfectly fine, so I would just say: trust the local drivers. </p>
					<p>The Petra trail entrance gates is on a road with many restaurants and food options. However, I suggest trying Jordanian food and it was delicious. The staple food there is bread and hummus, and not to mention it’s always suggested to taste the cuisine of the place you are visiting. </p>
					<p>The walk to the actual site from the entrance was in pitch black dark. It is extremely important that you stay with the people you came with and don’t run off. Having a handheld flashlight that’s not your phone can also be helpful. There is horse poop and donkey poop every step of the way, and I don’t know too many people that enjoy stepping in that. It is about a 2 mile walk and the terrain is very stony, lots of rocks, and as you enter the caved in area there are some parts that are extremely slippery. While we were walking, it actually started raining and that made the trek worse. I did not wear good footwear at all, so I highly recommend wear tennis shoes and not flip flops or your favorite pair of shoes. It took my family about 45 minutes to walk to the site, due to mainly the fact that my dad was taking his time, which is respectable. We were not the last ones and that was all that mattered to me. There were lots of large groups that kept passing one another and in the middle of October, a LOT of crowds, so stay close to your travel buddies or you can get lost in the crowds very easily. Don’t try to be the first one’s there either, the actual “show” doesn’t start until an hour after the entrance gates open. </p>
					<p>Once we made it, it was pitch black, there were a few lit up lanterns and it was enough to make our way through the enormous crowds to find a seat on the ground. Don’t get too comfy though, it’s just lined long mats in rows. During my experience it was raining, and it was wet-not ideal. There were also lots of dogs roaming the crowd which wasn’t too pleasant but they didn’t hurt a soul. The best place to sit is in the back for the best view. We weren’t even close to be the first groups there and got really good spots in the back rows. </p>
					<p>At a certain time, about 9:30 I believe, they turned on the lights. There, lit Petra with vibrant colors changing to music and to storytellers talking in the dark. It wasn’t very long and was not very cool either. They simply just changed the color schemes on Petra and called it a show, so kind of a disappointment for my family with high expectations after the 2 mile walk. However, if you walk in with an open mind, it can be a really soothing and fun experience. Then, the walk back-exactly the same way we came in. Pitch black with a few lanterns on the sides. </p>
					<p>Now, back up the hill was a little less frightening of a drive to the hotel. The next day we planned to visit Petra- during the day. We woke up that morning and had breakfast at the hotel and it was a decent continental breakfast. The view outside the Marriot Petra breakfast area was beautiful. It was honestly surreal to be standing there. On our way from the hotel to the entrance was once again frightening but at least it was day light. That day, we decided against walking to Petra, rather we were going to pay extra and ride the donkey. Each donkey carriage ride can only take 2 people max, so for me and my parents we had to pay for two. The donkey wasn’t very fast, the only advantage was that we weren’t walking. It still took about 20 minutes to get to the site. </p>
					<p>It was so amazing to be seeing my sixth world wonder-for the second time-but this time in daylight. It’s really spectacular that such architecture was discovered and first off, created so long ago. We took lots of pictures, as one does. There were many locals trying to sell things and all up in your face. However, my parents and I succumbed to the camel dude, and I rode a camel. It was pretty dope to say the least. </p>
					<p>We walked around to various other sites beyond the main temple. However, it was very repetitive and my parents don’t really like walking that much so we just saw a few places and got back on the donkey and rode back to the entrance. I would suggest that anyone who wants to experience the entire Petra experience to make an effort and walk around. They are long walks but one entire day from dawn to dusk should be enough to see everything The Lost City has to offer. </p>
					<p>Next: En route…Dead Sea. </p>
