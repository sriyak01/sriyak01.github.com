						<h2>The Dead Sea</h2>
						<p>An experience like no other</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic21.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>During my Jordan trip, we travelled from Amman Airport to Petra, and then we drove to the Dead Sea. If you haven’t already, go read the Sights of Petra blog first! En route Dead Sea, the drive was very scenic and beautiful and was about 3 hours. It was mountainous at times while also miles and miles of flat land. We saw a few llamas here and there too! There were a few times our driver was able to point out Israel while up on the mountains. </p>
					<p>We stayed at the Hilton Dead Sea Resort and it was a fun experience to be in an actual resort with multiple buildings and pools. The pools were beautiful with three different pools to go to and relax in. For infinity pool enthusiasts like myself, the Hilton Dead Sea Resort catered well.</p>
					<p>The trip to the actual sea was 3 elevators. Yep. We had to take three different elevators every time we wanted to go to the actual sea; there was no other alternative and that’s not including the elevator you may choose to take from your room to the lobby. Other than the taxing journey down to the sea, it was a wonderful hotel.</p>
					<p>Once down by the shore, you can see a small part of the sea marked off. This is marked off by the hotel as the only safe area. The Dead Sea is not exactly the normal beach you may imagine; however, it is an experience of a lifetime. There’s nowhere else in the world where you can naturally float in sea. With over 30% salinity, the Dead Sea allows you to stay completely afloat. There were a few lifeguards down by the sea that told us to first soak in the Dead Sea and taught us how to float. (You basically act like you’re sitting on the water and then slowly lay down) Also, it’s important to note, you do NOT want to put your face in the water or get any of the water in your eyes. The extreme salinity can burn and you’ll need the lifeguards to come over and wash you in normal water-not a fun experience. After we floated around for a while, the lifeguards gave us a mud bath. The “mud” they used was not directly from the sea. However, it is said you can definitely use the mud you pick up from the Dead Sea. I picked it up a few times and spread it on my body. Once we applied the mud all over our body, we waited 20 minutes to then wash it off in the Dead Sea! </p>
					<p>The displayed nutritional benefits from the use of the Dead Sea mud were innumerable! Personally, I did not see any drastic difference from the two times I went through the mud bath process. That’s also considering that I only did it twice. I’m sure if you go through the mud bath process every day, you can receive the nutritional benefits nature has to offer. Hair wise- the Dead Sea water damaged my hair for about two weeks and made it extremely frizzy. I got back my normal hair texture when I got it wet in another hotel pool two weeks later. I highly recommend trying your best to not soak your hair completely in the salt water.</p>
					<p>It was also neat to be able to “see” Israel. Right across the Dead Sea is all land that belongs to Israel. Although we did not step foot in the nation (which I hope to one day), the view was breathtaking!</p>
					<p>The Dead Sea adventure wraps up our Jordan tour! All in all, the experience was intriguing. Jordan is an extremely beautiful country that has so much to offer, even 1,388 feet below sea level. </p>
