						<h2>About Me: Sriya</h2>
						<p>A 17 year old with a passion for traveling. </p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Sriyar.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>At just five weeks old, I went on my first plane ride all the way across the country to San Francisco. My parents had no real reason other than to see their friends and took me along! That was the start to what would be a worldwide travel adventure in the following years. My parents were avid traveler from the start, but after I was born, that passion only grew.</p>
					<p>I am a normal high school girl, with AP classes, senior year coming up, and plenty of extra-curricular activities, and although my day to day life is constantly changing, travelling has always been a part of me. By the time I was 8 years old, I had stepped foot in six continents-all but Antarctica. Ever since then it has been my dream to one day step foot in Antarctica and that is yet to come! </p>
					<p>To date, my mom and I have traveled to exactly 40 countries, while my dad on the other hand has been to 45 countries. Every trip is just me, my mom, and my dad-the three of us- and we know how to truly take in every beauty of the world. There are many trips I remember we all skipped meals just to keep sight-seeing or we survived off of a granola bar. Now, at 17 years old, I am writing this blog to record my journey, give advice to any travel enthusiasts, and to document the thousands of memories I have made. This blog will focus on my personal experiences through each destination. I hope my stories inspire others to take a leap of faith and put down their day to day lives to explore the many, many beauties and wonders of the world. </p>
